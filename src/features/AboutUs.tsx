        ABLE was founded in 1997 focused on providing aids for people with
        physical disabilities. ABLE was established with the sole aim of
        assisting and encouraging women with disabilities to set up and run
        workshops that produce quality rehabilitation prosthetic and orthotic
        devices. Most of the women with disabilities do not have access to
        mobility aids for the simple reason that the technicians who need to
        measure them for aids and appliances are men, thus making the experience
        uncomfortable. Also, these women are completely dependent on their
        families for support. This need gave us the impetus to encourage women
        in these situations to take up this profession.
